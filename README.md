# randomized-queues-and-deques 
A Java implementation of the Randomized Queues and [Deques](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-ended_queue) data structures.

This project was completed for [Algorithms, Part I](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-to-algorithms)

If you're in that course or related course right now, obey all honor code requirements before viewing this code.  
I recommend that this code should only be viewed _after_ you've completed your own implementation.  
If you're super stuck, take a break, take a walk, and it will come to you; good luck.
